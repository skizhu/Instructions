                    <p class='instructtext'>Take 1 Dulcolax Tablet at 10:00AM. Eat a light breakfast (eggs and bread-no seeds). <br>
                        Afterwards take clear fluids only (clear broth, pop, juice, jello. tea, coffee, etc. – milk is okay).<br>
                        Take 1 bottle of Citro-Mag at 4PM (330ml) – it may taste better if chilled – with 1-2 liters of Gatorade (avoid the red color). Each patient is unique, but it generally takes 1-2 hours to work, with diarrhea lasting from some 3-4 hours afterwards.  <br>Vaseline can help soothe the bottom.<br>
                        All laxatives taste salty, and are better if chilled. The Gatorade minimizes the risks of dehydration. Clear Apple juice is an alternative.<br>
                    <b>Take all your usual medications.</b>  <br>Take the morning dose of diabetic pills and insulin, and no diabetic meds afterwards as you will not be eating. <br>
                        Please take all your preparation as directed since polyps and tumours can be missed if the bowel is not completely clear of residue.

                    <p class='instructtext'>
                        Take 1 bottle of Citro-Mag by mouth at 4:00 AM with 1 liter Gatorade (no red) or clear apple juice. <br>
                        The diarrhea usually finishes in 3-4 hours.  No breakfast or solid food until after the test. <br>
                        Water or black coffee/tea is OK (but NO milk).  No fluids for the 3 hours before arrival.   <br>                                      
                        Take all your usual morning BP and heart medications (but no water pills). <br>                                                                   
                        For diabetics take no meds/insulin, as the goal is to keep the sugar between 4-20 (high). <br>                                          
                        The procedure takes 30mins, but the total time spent in the hospital is about 2 hours . <br>                               
                        In the endo unit, after changing,  please use the toilet to complete the purge. <br>
